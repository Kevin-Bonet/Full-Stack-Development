    -web development involves using html for structyure, css for styling and javascript for functionality
    -replit is used as the coding environment for instruction 
    -lets make relevant files
    -html uses tags with things in between the opening and closing tags. 
    -examples: 
    <h1>Hi, welcome</h1> 
    <p>This is a  new paragraph</p>

    -to start a webpage, you need a <!DOCTYPE> declaration
    -everything within the declaration type like for example <html>stuff</html>
    -<body> tag goes within html tag
    -within the body tag we can use heading tags h1 to h6, lower the number, larger the text
    -<p> paragraph tag is for non header text, it wont be in bold like header text.
    -<a> is html attributes, it takes in parameters:
        example:
        <a href="https://google.com">Click this link</a>
    -<img> image tag doesnt need a closing tag, it just needs a source
        example:
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493612276216-ee3925520721?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8cmFuZG9tfGVufDB8fDB8fHww">

    -within an image tag, we can include attributes that modify the image, like height
    -within the paragraph tag we can also include attributes, for example: title
    -new line can be achieved by using <br> tag whihc is short for break
    -if we use a <pre> tag, we can write using several lines without having to use the break tag. Both the tag and content are space and line sensitive.
    -The <hr> tag is like the break tag, but for inserting horizontal lines into text
    -now moving on the formatting elements
    -<b> can be used to write bold text
    -<strong> is the same as <b>
