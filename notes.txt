    -web development involves using html for structyure, css for styling and javascript for functionality
    -replit is used as the coding environment for instruction 
    -lets make relevant files
    -html uses tags with things in between the opening and closing tags. 
    -examples: 
    <h1>Hi, welcome</h1> 
    <p>This is a  new paragraph</p>
    <tag>The content</tag>

    -to start a webpage, you need a <!DOCTYPE> declaration
    -everything within the declaration type like for example <html>stuff</html>
    -<body> tag goes within html tag
    -within the body tag we can use heading tags h1 to h6, lower the number, larger the text
    -<p> paragraph tag is for non header text, it wont be in bold like header text.
    -<a> is html attributes, it takes in parameters:
        example:
        <a href="https://google.com">Click this link</a>
    -<img> image tag doesnt need a closing tag, it just needs a source
        example:
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493612276216-ee3925520721?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8cmFuZG9tfGVufDB8fDB8fHww">

    -within an image tag, we can include attributes that modify the image, like height
    -within the paragraph tag we can also include attributes, for example: title
    -new line can be achieved by using <br> tag whihc is short for break
    -if we use a <pre> tag, we can write using several lines without having to use the break tag. Both the tag and content are space and line sensitive.
    -The <hr> tag is like the break tag, but for inserting horizontal lines into text
    -now moving on the formatting elements
    -<b> can be used to write bold text
    -<strong> is the same as <b>

    -continuing from last time
    -there is a difference between relative url and absolute url
    -in the link in new tab example, we could replace the google link with /go and get the replit website /go, since this is also a relative website
    -to clarify: google.com is a relative link, https://google.com is an absolute link, unrelated to the replit website we are using
    -we can get links to emails by using href:"mailto:username@email.com" within the a tag
    -titles and favicons...
    -title refers to what appears at the top of the tab:
        <head>
            <title>Write your desired title</title>
        </head>
    -favicon is the image/logo appearing before the title at the top of the tab
        <head>
            <title>Write your desired title</title>
            <link rel="icon" href="image-link">
        </head>
    -tables: in the body tag, use the <table></table> tag and table rows using <tr></tr> and table headings using <th></th> and table data with <td></td>
    -lists: for unordered list use <ul></ul>, for ordered lists use <ol></ol>for list items use <li></li>
    -if we want out lists to be descriptive use description lists using <dl></dl>, for each item use <dt></dt> and for the description per item use <dd></dd>
    -block elements and inline elements: block starts in a new line, inline doesnt and doesnt have a space before and after the element
